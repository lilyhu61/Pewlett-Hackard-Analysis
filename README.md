# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, write a report that summarizes this analysis and helps prepare manager for the "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age.
## Results
- I identified the 72,458 employees that are predicted to retire
- The title of Senior Engineer and Senior Staff have the most retirements coming up
- The title of manager does not have an eligible retirees for the mentorship program
- Thre is a stark difference between the amount of overall staff entering retirement and the amount of staff that is eligible for the mentorship program

**2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?**
  - As we can see in the table below, there are not enough qualified employees for the mentorship program. With the low numbers of qualified mentors, the mentors would be stretched thin, considerably.
